God is King, we the soldiers
Ultrabeam out the solar
When I get to Heaven's gates, I ain't gotta peak over
Keepin' perfect composure
When I scream at the chauffeur
I ain't mean, I'm just focused
I ain't mean, I'm just focused
Pour the lean out slower
Got us clean out of soda
Before the flood, people judge
They did the same thing to Noah
Everybody wanted Yandhi
Then Jesus Christ did the laundry
They say the week start on Monday
But the strong start on Sunday
Won't be in bondage to any man, John 8:33
We the descendants of Abraham
Ye should be made free, John 8:36
To whom the son set free is free indeed
He saved a wretch like me

If you woke then wake up
With Judas kiss and make up
Even with the bitter cup
Forgave my brothers and drank up
Did everything but gave up
Stab my back, I can't front
Still we win, we prayed up
Even when we die, we raise up (hallelujah)
Ain't no wantin', no, we need it
The powers that be done been greedy
We need ours by this evening
No white flag or no treaty
We got the product, we got the tools
We got the minds, we got the youth
We goin' wild, we on the loose
People is lying, we are the truth
Everything old shall now become new
The leaves will be green, bearing the fruit
Love God and our neighbor, as written in Luke
The army of God and we are the truth

Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like type write
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my Dad, he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"

I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like excite bike (Stretch my hands to you)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"

But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three a piece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like" (Stretch my hands to you)

I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryna not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father, I stretch)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life (Stretch my hands to you)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, "It ain't Christ-like"

Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all good, then I tried to talk to my dad (Stretch my hands to you)
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on me
I start spazzin' back, he said "That ain't Christ-like"

Closed on Sunday, you're my Chick-fil-A
Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
Hold the selfies, put the 'Gram away
Get your family, y'all hold hands and pray
When you got daughters, always keep 'em safe
Watch out for vipers, don't let them indoctrinate
Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
You're my number one, with the lemonade
Raise our sons, train them in the faith
Through temptations, make sure they're wide awake
Follow Jesus, listen and obey
No more livin' for the culture, we nobody's slave

Stand up for my home
Even if I take this walk alone
I bow down to the King upon the throne
My life is His, I'm no longer my own
I pray to God that He'll strengthen my hand
They will think twice steppin' onto my land
I draw the line, it's written in the sand
Try me and you will see that I ain't playin'
Now, back up off my family, move your hands
I got my weapons in the spirit's land
I, Jezebel don't even stand a chance
Jezebel don't even stand a chance

"How you get so much favor on your side?"
"Accept Him as your Lord and Saviour," I replied
Thou shalt love thy neighbor, not divide
I'ma ride, that's on God
His light shine the brightest in the dark
Single mothers know they got my heart
And all my brothers locked up on the yard
You can still be anything you wanna be
Went from one in four to one in three
Thirteenth amendment, gotta end it, that's on me
He the new commander and the chief
That's on Keef, that's on God
Before the ranch, I had horses in the garage
When the Forbes cover was just a mirage
They had me chasin' statues, that's on pride
"Oh my God," Bust said that's on Tribe
When I thought the Book of Job was a job
The Devil had my soul, I can't lie
Life gon' have some lows and some highs
Before the Grammy's ever gave a nod
I wore my heart on my sleeve, I couldn't hide
In '03, they told me not to drive
I bleached my hair for every time I could've died
But I survived, that's on God
I've been tellin' y'all since '05
The greatest artist restin' or alive
That's on L.A. Reid, that's on Clive
That's no Jive, that's on God
Off the 350s He supplied
The IRS want they fifty plus our tithe
Man, that's over half of the pie
I felt dry, that's on God
That's why I charge the prices that I charge
I can't be out here dancin' with the stars
No, I cannot let my family starve
I go hard, that's on God

Switch your⁠, switch your attitude
Go 'head, level up yourself
This that different latitude
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Life too short, go spoil yourself
Feel that feel, enjoy yourself 'cause

We have everything we need
We have everything we need
We have everything we need
We have everything we need
We have everything we need

Clean us like the rain in spring
Take the chlorine out our conversation
Let Your light reflect on me
I promise I'm not hiding anything
It's water
We are water
Pure as water
Like a newborn daughter

The storm may come
But we'll get through it because of Your love
Either way, we crash like water
Your love's water
Pure as water
We are water

Jesus, flow through us
Jesus, heal the bruises
Jesus, clean the music
Jesus, please use us
Jesus, please help
Jesus, please heal
Jesus, please forgive
Jesus, please reveal
Jesus, give us strength
Jesus, make us well
Jesus, help us live
Jesus, give us wealth
Jesus is our safe
Jesus is our rock
Jesus, give us grace
Jesus, keep us safe

Everything that I felt, praise the Lord
Worship Christ with the best of your portions
I know I won't forget all He's done
He's the strength in this race that I run
Every time I look up, I see God's faithfulness
And it shows just how much He is miraculous
I can't keep it to myself, I can't sit here and be still
Everybody, I will tell to the whole world, it's Him
King of Kings, Lord of Lords
All the things He has in store
From the rich to the poor
All are welcome through the door
You won't ever be the same
When you call on Jesus' name
Listen to the words I'm saying
Jesus saved me, now I'm saying
And I know, I know God is the force that picked me up
I know Christ is the fountain that filled up my cup
I know God is alive, yeah
He has opened up my vision
Giving me a revelation
This ain't 'bout a damn religion
Jesus brought a revolution
All the captives are forgiven
Time to break down all the prisons
Every man, every woman
There is freedom from addiction
Jesus, You have my soul
Sunday Service on a roll
All my idols, let 'em go
All the demons, let 'em know
This a mission, not a show
This is my eternal soul
This my kids, this the crib
This my wife, this my life
This my God-given right
Thank you, Jesus, won the fight

Cut out all the lights, He the light
Got pulled over, see the brights
What you doin' on the street at night?
Wonder if they're gonna read your rights
Thirteenth Amendment, three strikes
Made a left when I should've made a right
Told God last time on life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
Told the devil when I see him, on sight
I've been working for you my whole life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
I've been working for you my whole life
Nothing worse than a hypocrite
Change, he ain't really different
He ain't even try to get permission
Ask for advice and they dissed him
Said I'm finna do a gospel album
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
They'll be the first one to judge me
Feelin' like nobody love me
Told people God was my mission
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
Make you feel alone in the dark and you'll never see the light
Man, you're never seein' home and you never see the domes
I can feel it when I write, point of livin' in the right
If they only see the wrongs, never listen to the songs
Just to listen is a fight, but you booked me for the fight
It's so hard to get along if they only see the slight
From the love of religion
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it seem like nobody love me
I'm not tryna lead you to Visas
But if I try to lead you to Jesus
We get called halfway believers
Only halfway read Ephesians
Only if they knew what I knew, uh
I was never new 'til I knew of
True and living God, Yeshua
The true and living God
(Somebody pray for me)

Use this gospel for protection
It's a hard road to Heaven
We call on your blessings
In the Father, we put our faith
King of the kingdom
Our demons are tremblin'
Holy angels defendin'
In the Father, we put our faith

I love all your shit talkin', I love all your shit talkin’
You ain't got nothin' better to... do with yourself?

I done proved to myself, back on that rulin’ myself
I got new news to tell, act like you knew you done failed
Only true know how I feel and only if you knew how I felt
Sniffed a lil' bootch off the nail
Through with mixed messages, through with the mail
Only a few in the field, little bit off for the real

It feels so good, it should cost
Bought her alligator, I ain't talkin' Lacoste
Made me say, "Ugh, uh"
Like a mix of Master P and Rick Ross (uh, uh)
She seem to make me always feel like a boss (uh, uh)
She said I'm in the wrong hole, I said I'm lost (uh, uh)
She said I'm goin' too fast, I'm exhausted
Now drop to your knees for the offerin'
This the theme song, oh somethin' wrong
Might need an intervention for this new dimension
That's too new to mention, or fit in a sentence
If I get locked up, I won't finish the sent—

I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel freeee (scoop!)
Nothin' hurts me anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel freeee

Very rarely do you catch me out
Y'all done "specially invited guest"'d me out
Y'all been tellin' jokes that's gon' stress me out
Soon as I walk in, I'm like, "Let's be out"
I was off the chain, I was often drained
I was off the meds, I was called insane
What a awesome thing, engulfed in shame
I want all the rain, I want all the pain
I want all the smoke, I want all the blame
Cardio audio, let me jog your brain
Caught in the Audy Home, we was all detained
All of you Mario, it's all a game

Well, it took me long enough to rap on this strong enough
Paid this shit just gon' give up, 'cause Ye just gon' live up
To everything that sucks to you and that's never enough
Thought I'd be clever enough to give up while I'm ahead
I like breakfast in bed, but I love breakfast and head
For anybody who said that I was better off dead
Told 'em, "Don't ever believe nothin' that you ever read"
Got a Bible by my bed, oh yes, I'm very Christian
Constantly repentin', 'cause, yes, I never listen
Don't like bein' questioned and don't like bein' less than
Any a competition in any of my professions
So I gotta guess then, I gotta stay the best man
What else you expect from, uh, Mr. West, man
Painting from Wes Lang, hung in my space like a relative
That you ain't seen in a minute, called on the telephone
And when they see you they say, “Damn you got hella grown
Always thought you'd make it, but damn now you hella known"
Let's address some topics that I can embellish on
How we made enough bread for us to put some relish on
I won't relish on the fact I´m vibin' on the future
Ultralight buildin' in the buildin' by Miuccia
Herzog and de Meuron in an office out in Basel
No not Miami, Switzerland (Switzerland, ahahaha)

Everybody want world peace
'Til your niece get shot in the dome-piece
Then you go and buy your own piece
Hopin' it'll help you find your own peace
Bring light to what they don't see
Auntie cryin' on the concrete
Talkin' to dispatcher then the phone beep
On the other line was the homies
Told her that you ain't comin' home, see
When she heard the news it hurt her bone-deep
Caught with the rifle with the long reach
Just another cycle of the lonely
All growin' up in environment
Where doin' crime the requirement
They send us off to prison for retirement
Hopefully Alice Johnson will inspire men

Take what you want
Take everything
Take what you want
Take what you want

Better that I change my number so you can't explain
Violence in the night, violence in the night
Priors, priors, do you have any priors?

I hold up, like, "What?" I scroll, I scroll up like, "Next"
Guess who's getting exed? Like, next
Guess who's getting exed?
You made a choice, that's your bad
Single life ain't so bad, but we ain't finna go there
Something's off, I'll tell you why
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
What a grand plan to sell you out
I could scream and shout, let it out

I'll be honest, we all liars
I'll be honest, we all liars
I'm pulled over and I got priors
Guess we goin' down, guess who's goin' to jail?

Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?

More than I can say for you
Before the sons and the daughters
Before the sun and the water
More than I can say for you
But the truth still for you
Once I saw what the Lord do
God, the Son, all the glory
God the Father like Maury
Don't care what you say, nothin' on me
I don't care 'bout the lawyer fees
I don't care 'bout your loyalties
God'll solve it all for me
Trust man, he a failure
Trust and God'll heal you
Dustin, he a Hoffman
Don't fall what they offerin', uh
Fall far too often, yeah
Call God but don't call enough
Fall down but don't fall in love
I know God is all in us

We off the grid, grid, grid
This for my kid, kid, kid
For when my kid, kid, kids have kids
Everything we did for the crib

Everything we did, how we live
All this smoke got a scent
All that smoke kept a scent
Everything I spoke, what I meant
Never disguise my intent
lines outside the event
Brought my life out the trench
God, thank God
look what He did, did, did, did, did, did
We off the grid, grid, grid, grid, grid
What?
We off the grid, grid, grid, grid

We off the grid, grid, grid
This for my kid, kid, kid, kid
Everything we did for the crib did here
Flexin' with the business trip

You all still lit, lit, lit
I'm off the grid, grid, grid, grid
Off the grid, grid, grid, grid

First it go viral, then they get digital
Then they get critical, no, I'm not doin' no interview
Mask on my face, you can't see what I'm finna do
Had to move away from people that's miserable
Don't wanna link you, I ain't finna sit with you
Ain't finna talk to you, ain't finna get with you
Don't get me mad just 'cause I don't wanna injure you
She put my paintings inside of her living room
Look at the problems and issues I'm livin' through
They tryna drown me, I rise to my pinnacle
Walked through the block like the neighborhood general
Drop me the low and then that's where I'll send it to
I was forgettin' you, now I remember, now I remember
Did what I want, and I say what I want
And I thought you was with me, like how you get sensitive?
I got this God power, that's my leverages
I got this Holy Water, that's my beverages
I gotta help myself out of selfishness
I just bought a floor out of Selfridges
I gotta make sure they know who they messin' with
I gotta tell 'em sorry, they too delicate
I gotta stay with God where the blessings is
I ain't deliverin' Heavenly messages just for the hell of it
Don't try to test me
I keep it clean, but it could get messy
I talk to God everyday, that's my bestie
They playin' soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi
And this money could never neglect me
I pray that my family, they never resent me
And she fell in love with me as soon she met me
We both got a bag but my bag is more heavy
We have to start countin', it's gettin' too petty
You not a real stepper, you can't overstep me
Just sit back and listen and watch how He bless me
He wait 'til I fall and then pull up and catch me
Your check is too small, you can't run up and check me
Nah, nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me
Nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, I was out for self
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, I was up for sale

Here I go, on a new trip, here I go, actin' too lit
Here I go, actin' too rich, here I go, with a new chick
And I know what the truth is, still playin' after two kids
It's a lot to digest when your life always movin'
Architectural Digest, but I needed home improvement
Sixty-million-dollar home, never went home to it
Genius gone clueless, it's a whole lot to risk
Alcohol anonym-est, who's the busiest loser?
Heated by the rumors, read into it too much
Fiendin' for some true love, ask Kim, "What did you love?"
Hard to find what the truth is but the truth was that the truth suck
Always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, everybody so judgmental

Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals

Heal the wound and then you stab me in my back again (uh)

(Yo) Yo, yo (check our situation)
My men and my wom-

You need somethin' unexpected, some form of weapon
You ask him to feel protected, and still feel protected
Just one time for the record, just one time for the record
Don't agree with the message, don't agree with the methods

Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow

Man, it's too early
What the hell you doin' wakin' me up at 5:30?
Why the hell are you worried?
Play somethin' that is very, very vibe-worthy
I don't want my mind alerting
People sayin' tweetin' gonna make you die early
How 'bout have my heart hurtin'?
Hold it all inside, that could make you die early
Go on and get your best attorney
Something's there, feel it when I heard it
Just release the spirit, let it flow though
How these n- leaving now with one leg like Flo-Jo?
Nail me to the cross with long nails, like Coco
Free Throat Coat for the throat goats
Even if I gotta do it solo, even if I gotta do it with no promo
I ain't got my point across
'Til we finally get the cross and pass the point
So there's a couple things that I gotta quote
Don't involve yourself in things you don't have to know
I ain't never question what you was askin' for
I gave you every single thing you was askin' for
I don't understand how anybody could ask for more
Got a list of even more, I just laugh it off
I be goin' through things I had to wrote
Celebrity drama that only Brad'll know
Too many family secrets, somebody passin' notes
Things I cried about, I found laughable
Lil' baby Jesus, ain't laughin', no
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know
The big man upstairs ain't laughin', no
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know

"Okay, I didn't throw a fit when you said you wanted to leave
I told you I loved you, but you didn't believe
You were too easily fooled, so easily deceived
By some dude who's more rather into greed
Played by your emotions, you were swamped by your needs
Told me, I didn't believe, you said I was out to deceive, ahaha
You said that I lie, how did I? I told you everything, didn't I?
But you just could not believe, man, I'm so peeved
Your friends all up in your head even when we're in bed
Your mind's elsewhere, and you say you care? Haha
I'm laughin' at you all, you think you got me? No, no
My back ain't against the wall" (the wall, the wall, the wall, the wall)

Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light (right on)
One last sparkle to follow

Exhausted
Never the right time to go
Getting the right time to go
Never the right time to go
God loves you
Love when you choose your steps
Gotta make it right 'fore you left
Gotta make it right before you
Everybody wanna feel like
Everything gon' be right
New me over the old me
Let it out, let it all out

Make it right, now that feels right
Nothing else ever feels right
Nothing else ever feels right

Bow our heads 'cause it's alright, alright, mm
Twenty-four hours, twenty-four candles
Twenty-four hours (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Throw our hands up in the sky
Yes, Lord, we put 'em high
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Please don't ask again, who's up in the van?
They my only fans
I was in my hovercraft, had another laugh
How you roll with them? When you know I'm him

Got it on remote control
Got it on remote control
Got it on remote control, like a CEO
I thought you should know

On my Instagram, it get outta hand
Why you so mad?

He got it on remote control, like a CEO
Feelin' like the man, feelin' like the man
I was in my hovercraft, floatin' down the path
God just grabbed my hand, had a bigger plan

How can I get through? (Don't leave so soon)
How can I get through? (To the moon)
How can I get through? (To the moon)
Early afternoon, I wanna go to the moon (take you to the moon)
Don't leave so soon (whoa)
Don't leave so soon
How could I get through? (Yeah)
How can I get through? (Ooh)
Early afternoon

Don't leave so soon (ooh)
Don't leave so soon (don't leave so soon)
How could I get through? (How can I get through?)

Children growing, women producing
Men go work and some go stealing
Everyone's got to make a living

No more promos, no more photos
No more logos, no more chokeholds
We on Bezos, we get payrolls
Trips to Lagos, connect like LEGOs
Make this final, make this, my eyes closed
Burn false idols, Jesus' disciples
I can feel your pain now, I done bled my vein out
New level the game now, simulation changed
No more problems, no more argue
No more askin', "Who really are you?"
I know the real you, you know we feel you
You know He hears you, you know we with you
Straight from Beirut, Chicago, Beirut
You cray? We cray too
You pray? We pray too
Never too late for Him to save you
This your movie, 'cause no one can play you
Devil, lay down, Devil, lay down
This that level, make devils pray now (Heaven and Hell)
Hold up, no peace, hold up, police
Don't call police, just stay focused (is on Earth)
Pray for new life, pray for new breath
Hey, Lord, make sure it's safe for who's left (Heaven and Hell)
Know you can't find a place to rest
Know the Lord my bulletproof vest (is on Earth)
When we survive, know that we blessed
Save my people though the music

Let it grrat, let it grrat, grrat
Let it grrat, grrat, grrat, grrat, grrat
Grrat, grrat, grrat
Let it grrat, let it grrat, grrat
Let it grrat, grrat, grrat, grrat, grrat
Let it grrat

The Devil is using you, confusing you
Our job is to understand who is who
Righteous indignation in this nation
We gon' start a revolution in this basement
And at the end of the day it's truly restless
Y'all had y'all statistics and all them goofy questions
Y'all had y'all fake leaders don't worry we got it
And plus it's only twenty-one days to break a habit

Mama I need you to tuck me in
I done made some mistakes and they rubbed it in (boy)
I know you and grandma had enough of them (boy)
Why I gotta be so stubborn then? (boy)

I'm doin' this one for y'all
So we can end racism once and for all

How many prisons they gon' make? (all)
Watch the safe, one hand wash the other
Both hands wash the face

oh-ooh-ooh
Keep my spirit alive
Keep my spirit alive, alive

More than enough
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
The spirit won't die-ie
Oh, oh, all my life, yeah
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize

Sittin' by myself, I'm just thinkin'
About all I've been through, I wish I was dreaming (Jesus)
Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Lord)
I watched so many people leave (Jesus, Lord)
I see 'em change by the season, that's mama's seasonin'
God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin' in
I know I made a promise that I'd never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I've been losing all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I've been swimmin' on the deepest end
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain't no love there
You been down so much you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)
And while they introduce the party, they say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Did He tell you that you good and just stay focused? (Lord)
Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousin in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army
'Cause they been killin' n- since n- was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I have nightmares (Lord)
'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here
Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night terrors when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, can I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
And better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama steady crying, 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)
And she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it
Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy says she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
Now she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
But is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that been built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side
He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)
He even let him get the last meal
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, "N-, stand still" (Jesus)
"You took my brother life, you made my mother cry" (Lord)
"Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ"
He said, "Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ"
Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus, Lord)

If I hit you with a "W-Y-D?"
You better not hit me with a "H-E-Y"
It better be like "Hiiii" with a bunch of I's
Or "Heyyy" with a bunch of Y's
I, I lived a hundred lives, uh
So, that mean I had a hundred wives
And I am just simply high off life for the hundredth time

Never let nobody curve me that don't deserve me
Should I really have bought the Burberry last Thursday?
Wear a different color jersey every Thursday
'Posed to meet in Malibu, you postin' pics in Jersey
Is to lay me or play me, a bigger flex though
'Cause you know you'd never live up to my ex, though
If we dive, it's the deep end, baby, let's go
I'll be gone by the weekend, baby, XO

Most insane out of body experience
And I repent for everything I'ma do again (I accept Him)
And I repent for everything I'ma do again

If you take the ride, please don't close your eyes, uh
In a den of thieves, every man disguise, uh
Keep your mask on, keep it hanitized, uh
It's a rollercoaster, keep your hands inside, uh
Wanna bring your pain, 'member this advice, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
He gon' part the tides, He gon' part the skies, uh
Did it for the fame, 'member this advice, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
He gon' part the tides, He gon' part the skies, huh
When they start to lie, 'member this advice, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
When they start to lie, 'member this advice, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh

When you said give me a ring, you really meant a ring, huh?
Turned out to be more than just a fling, huh?
Three hours to get back from Palm Springs, huh?
Who you know spend an hour in Walgreens, huh?
You know you'll always be my favorite prom queen
Even when we in dad shoes, or mom jeans
Too many complaints made it hard for me to think
Would you shut up? I can't hear myself drink
We used to do the freak like seven days a week
It's the best collab since Taco Bell and KFC, uh
Talk to me nicely, don't come at me loud
You had a Benz at sixteen, I could barely afford a Audi
How you gon' try to say sometimes it's not about me?
Man, I don't know what I would do without me
Billionaire sport, step up to the court
They rented a room, we bought the resort
God got me, baby, God got the children
The devil run the playground, but God own the buildin'
Time went silence, a luxury
Cussin' at your baby mama, guess that's why they call it custody
God got us, baby, God got the children
The devil run the playground, but God own the buildin'
Time and space is a luxury
But you came here to show that you still in love with me
Startin' to feel like you ain't been happy for me lately, darlin'
'Member when you used to come around and serenade me, whoa
But I guess it's gone different in a different direction lately
Tryna do the right thing with the freedom that you gave me (Wheezy outta here)
Your gun off safety
Speak first, don't break me
Harsh words, you're angry
Lord, don't take me, oh, oh

But, uh, umh, well, well, here goes
Well, here goes, but here goes
I was one of them weirdos of the pure soul
That would go to the flea market to buy fake clothes
Every color Girbaud's, every Cutlass is cold
Every cousin that stole, every summer was cold
Out of all of the Moes, out of all of the Folks
After all of the jokes, I'm the one that was chose
All of my friends love to gang bang
How we in my car, and you say we ain't in the same lane?
When we both had Pelles on
And we was scammin' for the prom before Chief Keef was "Bang, Bang"
Always had mob ties, stood on my six points, how could I not rise?
Love, truth, peace, freedom, justice, but I'm not five
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
And for all the guys that went to the White House and said, "Free the old man"
Every day I put my life on the line to feed the whole clan
Personal worth is not what a person is worth
I can give a dollar to every person on Earth

Man, it's gotta be God's plan
Man, I swear these boys keep playin'
We gon' have to square up then
We gon' have to send it up then
We gon' have to send it up then
We gon' have to send it up then, uh
We gon' have to send it up then
We gon' have to send it up then
My favorite place to send it

It ain't how it used to be
This the new me, so get used to me
It ain't how it used to be
This the new me, so get used to me
Lookin' in the mirror, it's the truth of me
Lookin' at my kids, it's the proof of me
Devil get behind me, I'm loose, I'm free
Father, Holy Spirit, let loose on me
Father, I'm Yours exclusively
Devil get behind me, I'm loose, I'm free
Father, Holy Spirit, let loose on me
Father, I'm Yours exclusively
Devil get behind me, I'm loose, I'm free
Devil get behind me, I'm loose, I'm free

Here go all your problems again (I thank God)
Three, two, one, you're pinned (I thank God)
Uncle, now he back in the pen' (He's done for me, hallelujah)
Auntie shut down again (hallelujah)
Did she finally come to life? (Thank you, Jesus)
Ever wish you had another life?
Ever wish you had another life?
Ever wish you had another life?

Don't you wish the night would go long?
I've been feelin' low for so long
I ain't had a high in so long
I been in the dark for so long
Night is always darkest 'fore the dawn
Gotta make my mark 'fore I'm gone
I don't wanna die alone
I don't wanna die alone
I get mad when she gone
Mad when she home
Sad when she gone
Mad when she home
Sad when she gone (lose it right now, go, spirit that wants to run)
Floatin' on a silver lining (in the name of Jesus)
Yeah, you know where to find me, ridin' on a silver lining
And my God won't deny me, tell the Devil, "Get behind me"
All the stars are aligned, lift me up every time
You know exactly where to find me
(Hallelujah, thank you, Jesus, hallelujah, hallelujah)

Did those ideas ever really come to life?
Make it all come to life
Make it all come to life
Prayin' for a change in your life
Well, maybe it's gon' come tonight

Sadness settin' in again
Three, two, one, you're pinned
Uncle, right back in the pen'
Tell me how auntie been
Took your thoughts and penciled 'em in
Should've wrote 'em down in pen
And maybe they'll come to life
And maybe they'll come to life

Sadness settin' in again
Three, two, one, you're pinned
Uncle, right back to the pen'
Tell me how auntie been
Thoughts, you had penciled 'em in
Probably should've wrote 'em in pen
And maybe they'll come to life
They could finally come to life
They could finally come to life

You know where to find me, they cannot define me
So they crucify me, how so fazed when I leave?
Come and purify me, come and sanctify me
You the air that I breathe, the ultra-ultralight beam
Bought a gift to Northie, all she want was Nikes
This is not about me, God is still alive, so I'm free
Floatin' on a silver lining, floatin' on a silver lining
So when I'm free, I'm free

He's done miracles on me
He's done miracles on me
He's done miracles on me
He's done miracles on me
He's done miracles on me
He's done miracles on me

Momma, your son in the red hat, had suffered set-backs
Had shouldn't-have-said-thats, had made everyone mad
He made 808s, so he's everyone dad, know he ever gets sad
Hotel rooms by the shore, close my eyes, I can see more
Nobody punkin' me, nobody pressure me, nobody gangsta me
Especially, when the gangstas eat thanks to me
And my favorite principal name was Mrs. Wooten
She was strict, the perfect instructor for young Putin
Vladimir, just so that is clear
Whom should we fear when we know dad is here?
(Daddy's right here, daddy's right here)
I don't play, boy
Over y'all dead body 'fore my daughter pose in Playboy
We don't condone over-sexualization of the kids in the home
Battery in my back, this house of pain won't ever last
CyHi told me to my face that Sicko Mode was his biggest song
Well go'n, cause Donda was the best ghostwriter I ever had
South Park had jokes about fish sticks
Till this day the whole team can kiss this dick
I put Virgil and Drake on the same text
And it wasn't about the matching Arc'teryx or Kid Cudi dress
Just told these grown men stop it with the funny shit
I might hire the whole team from ACG
So don't text me like I'm Juanita JCV
Or more important, Monica Corgan, who was there for me
Somebody really there for me, was rare for me
That was new air to breathe
When I was underappreciated, undervaluated
Stockholders told me, "Board rooms will bore you"
And remember going by your rules, try to follow the Lord's rules
Thought we was the new Abu Dhabi
Told Drake don't play with me on GD
And he sent that message to everybody
So if I hit you with a "W-Y-D"
You better hit me with, "Yes sir, I'm writing everything you need"
I told you I was gonna take the summer back
So any of the cap, won't take none of that
Where my motherfuckin' red hat?
Security and the nannies be forever handling
I can't stand it when there's talks of
Putting the kids back in Sierra Canyon when daddy got his own school
Trav, smile for these white people if you want (C'mon)
While we build a team to get Hoover out the joint
I do what I want, bro, in my life
Serve and protect long as it's my wife
Screaming on M-A-Ns for trying to lower the percentage of SKIMS
See, I was going in back when they thought I was only making Ms
Now it's 9 billi', you ain't gotta like me but you feel me
Do y'all feel me? Really?
Get off Scott Free, I'm talking Ridley
Get off our knees, that's if you're with me
Get off your knees, that's if you're with me
Get off your knees and let's get free
Get off your knees and let's get free
Quickly, I mean really
Really, I mean really
I need release, I don't need police, I'm like, "nigga, please"
Y'all can't hear me, mmm-mmm-mmm
For the real me, for the real me, I mean, mmm-mmm-mmm
For the real me, mmm-mmm, for the real me, mmm-mmm-mmm

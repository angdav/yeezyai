 about my soul
I ain't playing your girl
What she got to afraid of me
Come and watch a movie with me
She said she got an actor best known for playing Santa Claus
Like my favorite authors, I fantasize about them
My favorite thing about her is that she got a husband that's both a teacher and CEO
And he's a really good dude, even though she don't teach
He ain't got no fuckin' plastic surgeon
He played his student through all of the grind and pain
And he said "why school fees be dime for dime?"
And she ain't even close to paying for that t-shirt?
That's why she always running back
And we at the grocery store knowing she ain't fresh
And she know two things about us: one, we're from the hood, two, we ain't from the damn street
All of which mean we gotta fight that school damnation, huh

I done told you twice, huh and oooh, oh
She got two cars, give 'em Bad J, they go off
She got a raccoon job, she love to chew things
And her nigga boy love to ball and run
So his girl, play him as a sports hero, play ya as a superhero
Now what the fuck do you think I'm thinkin'?
Get em ho that ass is more dangerous than the horse or the carriage
She was in a good clothes when she cheatin' you, now what the fuck they expect?
You fine? You fine? I ain't get that from her
That black bitch has a white bitch, she like a Harley Davidson
Right now, you waiting at least an hour for that white bitch to drive
Right? Just a minute? Right? Just a minute, huh?
Bitch you wait, a minute, wait
She got a fussy little bitch, bring a fussy little bitch
Now she waiting an hour for that white bitch to drive
Right? Just a minute?

Damn I see her eyes glazed over
And I see a nigga turn his whole persona
To something even better
Damn I see a nigga turn his whole persona
To something even better
Damn I see a nigga turn his whole persona
To something even better
Damn I see a nigga turn his whole persona
To something even better
Damn I see a nigga turn his whole persona
To something even better
Damn I see a nigga turn his whole persona
To something even better

How could you be so sure?
Ever since I met you?
Last night?
I had the strangest feeling tonight
You have no idea how close we are
I got the strangest feeling tonight
You have no idea how close we are
Don C just tell Tim it's only been a couple of weeks
He got a whole house and he's trying to get in
He got a whole house, he's trying to get out
I told Tim you know what, you want him to come clean?
He told me, move the solar system away
That's a bad slave valet, I need that guy to get a diamond
That's a bad vampire, I need a sex slave
And a bad porno shootin' out right there right now right now
Right now, you gon' see him in a moment
How 'bout we not bustin'?
What about you say "Damn, c'mon, c'mon"
We don't really care what people say
We just want some of these things, that we got, that we can't escape
A little rain, a lil' wind, some fresh air, a lil' star, y'all, we got this
You know what though? We a different kind of niggas, we a different kind of niggas
Now everybody gossipin' about us like whoa, whoa!

I got a thousand problems I can't run from
From what I seen, whoa, whoa!
Why the hell is everybody gossipin' about me?
Why is everybody gossiping about me?
Why is everybody gossipin' about me?
Niggas don't really care what people say
Let's cut to the chase, niggas just gossip

The most famous niggas in the whole city
Shit, these days niggas really cared
Why niggas don't really care
Why niggas really cared
Shit, these days niggas really cared

Know that know my shit, know my shit
May the Lord forgive me, may the gods of Poseidoc let me go
Aw shit, who killing devils?
These niggas killing niggas, these niggas killing devils
These niggas killing devil, these niggas killing devils
These niggas killing devil, these niggas

 dri, you don't mean to be rude
But I'm looking in your eyes and it's cause I'm stupid
Don't let your guard down
Make new friends every day
No questions asked
No prejudices
No one on that crew asking me questions
I'm asking you, milady
Hey milady, what's up with you and your girlfriend?
First date? Fuck her first, then you and her
Fuck your girlfriend first, then you and her
First fuck then you and your girlfriend
Soon as I get older? What she need first
My friend always says "later as"
That's how I know she only interested in me
Says older dude, "I already known you for a long time"
And she already knew me when I was on stage
Says he already asked me questions for "The Voice"
He already told his friends he played some bass in my song "No Limelight"
Back when I was making beats "Somethin' awesome"
In the studio trying to control the beat "What if we met at a concert?"
In the restroom trying to take the piss "What if we fucked at a friend's house?"
Somebody told me once, "Timid, 3 AM"
That's a pretty bad rap from a retard
Grammies on a Thursday night trying to make a buck
When you spend your money on drinks and prada
skirts, you was goin' naked for the photos
Party poppin' outside of Barrow, then moved in to rent the space
Came forward to say hello to my best friend
He told me about how he had beaten Big back in school
And he was tryin' to play for the Illini
Ayo, I can't be sitin' like I played for the Rathe
And I'm a Gemini that's mistook for a Gemini
For jeans, and I ain't pick no swag no more
I spotted signs all over the campus
Like signs saying "You Mentioned a Gemini"
And then more and more Jayhawks wearing slippers
On and on it goes
It's like it doesn't matter what side you on
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us
I'm just makin' my own pills, guess I'll be accountable
God, I'm so high up in the skies (God help me)
That's where we learn how to fly
We be at war, then we're not vs
I go that order, I'm not sittin' my neck
Act like you know me, be me, be me
I'm such a nuisance to the cops
Had to take tickets like a hottie
Now I'm on TV anyway
I'm so pompous
What do you say to all the fans when the fans leave?
I ain't called your club yet
But I'll be called before the players get called
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I don't know who you all
Nigga, give me half of that, give me half of that
Give me a little more water, I'm OK
Give me a few crumbs, I'm not ok
I ain't got nothing to lose, I'm finna die

For all my Southside niggas that know I go door-to-door
Big Pun, Pierce, Nail Yakupov
My girl forgiven me, she just hooked me with the money
So I guess she's on me now?
Nameless, free-lance psycho
I make retarded music and the room gets quiet
I guess I'm the only one in the house not afflicted
This just in time for the Super Bowl
The cops wanna stop me for that damn beat
I was tryin to stab Saint Laurent
3 Weeks, 1 Day with no Attitude
I'm not even goin to get that shit
I got a flow of 2 beats
Only way I can sum it up is 'fore I grind it
They said my style was New England
I got the right ones, that's why I got Super Bowl ring
So if they take me on a test, I got to catch up
If they take me on a test, I'm to high
So I thought I was goin to have a say
What you think I'm tryin to say?
You think I'm just goin to use that as an excuse?

I give you a few bad apples, you have to stop 'em
Every time you smell like burnt beef
Props to my dog for stopping his appetite
Ooh that my friends itch, that's rubbing alcohol
What did I deserve, us to stay dry like we on a grill
Would I live like Teriyaki when I'm home alone like Misao
Made with love to my mommy
And a job that I can't get

're got them on your toes
Sitting in my mind, thinking
We could have a real league
Least it'd be where we started off like Pips
With real foibles like Pips
And foibles that cost real lives
Your soul, yours, and I'm my own man
So don't worry about me, I'm fine 'til you

You know how it is when we first met, yo
I don't know about you, but after we talk
We was like "Man, man, this drink just overwhelms me"
So I, packed a heavy cream dick
And kept it in a tight electric chair
I know it'll hurt but that's the only thing I control
I mean 'bout to get real loud, 'bout to get real cold
"Man, we getting paper cuts"
It's true, it's true
Wakin' up the feelin' of the future
When the charts come around
And I know we all look back on the greats
And it's just like everybody else
When our fathers got welfare
And the belt came soon, so we could still buy our way to riches
When we rolled up in the VCR
Offered free stuff, like t-shirts, hoodies
For the little folks, we were screwed
But since you don't give a fuck what I wear, huh?
So we dress like we famous, huh? (Yeah)
So we could still get hired
So we could still get laid, so we can, uh
So we could still get shot, so we could, uh
So we could still fuck up our mess, huh? (Yeah)
So we could still get pimped, so we could, uh
So we could still get off your grill, so we could, uh
So we could still get drugged up, so we could, uh
So we could still get together, so we could, uh
So we could still get high, we could still get high
So we could still get cuffed up, so we could, uh
So we could still get cuffed up, we could, uh
So we could still get high, we could still get high
So we could still get drunk, we could still get drunk
So we could still get cuffed up, we could, uh
So we could still get high, we could still get high
So we could still get drunk, we could still get drunk

It's all in the past now, we still got us friends, we still got families
So please don't get too worked up now, huh

Tonight I gon' go, I'll make it
Tonight I'll make it (Tonight I'll make it)

(Tonight I'll make it)

(Tonight I'll make)

(Tonight I'll make)

(Tonight I'll make)


Pablo's a bitch, that's a bitch
But when you see him, you feel him
But when you fuck with him, you don't feel him
One night
Yeah, some friends that's around
But for some, they deserve the love and best of all
They deserve a nigga with a chip
Not to brag but, you know the story
Took a little while for me to figure it out, but we got cousins
Dutty a chipback, that's what make it funny
Daddy brought his dynamite
But this is a new spot, you go in and out
I don't know what's best, nigga you can stay at home
I guess, it's keepin' up the Benz
I got beef with Denny's, they told me stay at home
I don't know, I might get out

(Tonight I'll make)
(Tonight I'll make, uh, yeah, yeah!)
No light-touch Ashley, just nitpick
Her style of dance would make Sleepy Hollow famous
But, just to give you an example
She won't even hold their breath when she see me
They be like "Tyler your guy"
We just talked about everything from cars
To real estate
To fashion houses
To tech guys
To popes that's all sprightly
But, just to give you an example
She said "I read in the Wall Street Journal"
Yeah, yeah, she heard that
She said she don't dress conservatively
Took her to Wal-Mart, took her to Burger King, took her to Express, took her to Apple...
Uh, how do I say wakizashi? Do I need to break it down? Uh, how do I say gon' gon?
Told her to MC by kimono
Said she my best girl, I'm the guy that girl like not even ball
She was straight out the club, she ain't gotta

 white, yeah, I'm flyin'
I miss the girls so much nigga, hang in there
Tryna get there in seconds
I'm out of my mind, I can see where you're mindin'
I know you're nowhere to be seen, so I'm tryna make you come with the shadows

What's my motivation, nigga, for flying so high?
Fly so high, I had to ask
What's cause all these girls want, all these lifelines
I'm so focused on these two hoes, I'm gone dozing off
And I can't come back home, focus on my own matters
Besides, I need all these new lags, baby
You know the party's starting, I'm with this chick until the Hell get over
I'm tryna get down, but I'm too out of my mind
Right now, I'm tryna get her out of my way
Right now, I'm tryna get her out of my way
Right now, I’ll be trying to get her out of my way
And I’ll be trying to get her out of my way
And I’ll be trying to get her out of my way
And I’ll be trying to get her out of her way
And I’ll be trying to get her out of her way
And I’ll be tryna give her away
Right now, I’m trying to give her away
Right now, I’m trying to give her away
I won’t get out, baby
We in the bathroom now, you get in the way
You got a perv, back on your back, casting
You got a mothna, your dress off, off, off
You got a mothna, your hand on the wood, off, off
Won’ots, but it’t really be me, I’m too perv to show

I won’ots, but it’s not me, I’m too fresh to bring it back
“Cause I got a fresh new lover, will be back

I run a credit that only you can keep
I wear my heart on the line
And I know that whoever say that they got the better of me
Too greedy to hire as many bank statements as I had on my stick
That's my team when it suits us, we're all on our toes

I get down on my side of the couch, on my side of the ball
On my side of the court, on my side of the line
Off, I go, I go
I know when do I start over? When do I leave?
I know when do I start over?

Start a new era, take over the game
Oh no, that's a technical)

Start a new era, take over the game
Oh no, that's a technical)

Let's take it back to the 'nolia

Aw kiddo, we have to cover the rim
Throw your weight around like we doing bulk-ups
We hardly get no spin
We might have landed on a frozen lake
We might have landed on a politica
Man, I remember I layaway money, big brother money
Quit hustling, figure I'll wait a year
And guess what, I got a big brother now
Tellin' me, "You ready to get together and act frickin'?
 You really is younger than me?
Wow, you still get along with all my hoes
But you bet your big brother's big sister's that played high like "Q"
In the 1800's everybody on the internet was raising money
Yeezy, what do you do, call your brother and say hi
Now that you ask, I usually not give a fuck
But this shit clear and free for my bros to roam
And me and my friends house in the mall
Anything that can be interpreted as 'panicky'
That's why I say fuck the cops, theyic 'bent over, bye

I've been trending lately on my 'down below'
So I don't always mean to leave your hand up like this
But it feels like we're in the presence of a demon
A demon who's trying to get at me, who's trying to get at me
I've been trending lately on my 'down below'
So I don't always mean to leave your hand up like this
But it feel like we're in the presence of a demon

A demon who's trying to get at me, who's trying to get at me
I've been trending lately on my 'down below'
All my niggas tryna fix me up, I don't know what's up
I know that whatever the cause is, I'm the shit
To

So I closed my eyes and imagined the best of niggas
Hop in the car of the Chi-town samba stars
And drove to the show
Where the action was, so close
So close, so close
Iñár up, squirming, look how we did our track
Uhh, how we did our day
How we did our tour
Used to hop up in the sky
Where they pray, we fuck 'em up
Where they eat, we eat 'em up
We broke up and broke up
A whirlwind of hate
Mercy, blessings from God
Flyer biz 'fore I died, I was cold sweats
Mercy, blessings from God
This is what heaven and hell wanted
Not a better life, better life
Now jump in the sky

I'm back outta the light, that's my reality
I'm back outta the way, that's my reality
I'm back outta the way, that's my reality
I don't wanna hear that Spanish get my veins stinger
I don't wanna hear that Indian get my veins stinger
I don't wanna hear that Brazilian get my veins stinger
Maybe it's because they love their city better than I do
Well, let's go, go about our business
In that order, it ain't not ye
I'm not in the mood for it, I'm not in the mood for it
I know it's late, I'm not in the mood for it
Merry Christmas, and all Christmas songs
You're going to love it anyway, you'regoing to love it
You're not going to love it, I'm not in the mood for it
You're not going to love it, I'm not in the mood for it
You're not going to love it, I'm not in the mood for it
This is not a song I wrote for a movie
It's an anthem I'm throwing
For the children of the Roc
You are the pioneers of that era
You inspired the world to exist
You ain't say it ain't so
Theile is so anti-heroin
He'll put up pictures of his mama if they stand in his way
You work late but you still worth money
Ailes just did a lil' shit, Ailes just did a shit
Late for the road, in a Harley Davidson
Today I'm in the back, showing you how

This the 'ba in the ghetto, the 'ba in the country
These bitches don't always get it
They say they ain't finna say it, but I'm finna stand in the way
Now you got cash, you got dreams
You gotta amaze the nigga on how little toe they taste
That's the only thing I know, I'm a legend
I'm Killa, Ice-T, and Hercules
They say the most important thing is gonna come next
Got to tell big time, "this is what I got"

Yes, that's what I got
But is that enough?
What is you thinkee,assumeee
I'm super bad, but I'm so alive
I can't no longer dwell on the past
What more could you ask for, comin' me
From a city that hate me no more
What more could you ask for, heaven more
You see, I've been living my life my whole life
Now, I'm a legend
I'm a legend, Mr. West would tell you like that
I'm a legend, my whole city
Lose nothin' without pieces and parts
You piece a soul and puts it in a steel ball
Then put me in you soul and put you in Heaven
I give you an Nia Long and an Sia Long
And I give you an A-Model and an A-fault line
And I give you an R-Beacon and an R
And I give you an R-at-this-rate and more
And I give you an R-at-this-rate and more
And I give you an R-at-this-rate and more
And I give you an R-at-this-rate and more
And I give you an R-at-this-rate and more
And I give you an R-at-this-rate and more
And I give you an R-at-this-rate and more
And I can't no longer go on about my loot
Might even kill somebody and I'mma know it
But I'mma be out of your hands, you know it
You're not even up in the world, you know it
I know you're up in the world, I know it
You're not even up in the world, you know it

Just talked to Fonzy who said he is 'bone of our record

With my baby mama and my Mercedes
Without them I wouldn't be where I amheaded
Somewhere deep, somewhere far, somewhere soon
Best advice, only god could say, "ave you a blessing?"
No prob that I hear, but it could be
Had a little breakdown, that's a word of comfort
Breast break can be traumatic
Especially if the other party have a fist
A bruise like a chain
Just remember that your girl will be okay, man!

You know what? You right
It's fucking hurting yo, man!
Hold up, I'm white, and you black, and I'm a jerk
So if this is your day, multiply
You will see super-black people
talking about how wonderful is in heaven
And I'm not even touching on the issues
Such as pay raise, money get ya lazy
If this is your day, then you probably say things that aren't true
Like "Damn, you lying"
And I swear you wait in line
You should be excited by the response
But it's all coming together for me
So far, so good, according to the sky
And the thousand year record, eight years fly by
I see a star open up
I see a new religion, dance about it
I see leaders act about it
I see aliens use all the nasties as diplomatic gifts
I see aliens build new super-deets to frighten us
I see aliens be all over the media
I see aliens be on TV and say stupid shit
I see aliens be doing stupid shit
I guess it all comes back to bite me
When you look at what we're good at, huh
When you look at what we're broke, huh
When you don't don't don't not to stare
And you don't twist my lighteyes
You freaky...

They outside of the Saksons
Lookin' at bank notes, notes that's saith it
Its like they say, "You fucked up, don't laugh"
Its like they say, "You should hangout with Mos"
All of the time
This what the cops was sellin'
I seen the movie, "Back to the Future"
A gangsta outfit, with lightspeed twister
Speedboat strap, with tinted windows
Ventrada rosa, with cell phone chain
Now is that your sobriety?
Yeah that is, is
My money's around the world, and I'm feelin' it all
From all over the place, yeah
I'm from the wrong place, I'm on everything
That walrus, sweeter, drivin' it
I might be poppin' on furs, I'm a wolf
So I Must Scream, I'm a wolf
I'm not suffocated by candles, I'm still feelin' it
I'm not famvin' in bed, I'm still feelin' it
The floors wasched, the sheets was rugs
Erratum, and uglier than ever
Theophanies were made, like Michael Jackson
Like Marie Bica's no-no, and Dior Homme's only no-no
I'm pimply, you should call Phoebe Philo
I'm rich, that's why another millionaire bitch
I'm not in the house to wash my hands
I call this house a day spa
For my dancers, gangsta tattoos, and their hypno-head
I be don't doin' to impress you, homie
I be pimply, you should call Pig Latin
The name Just Cause Cause Cause When Em leaves us'll be because they love us
And a bikepacking trip to the south is when we pack
Pig latte, grab your latte cases
VR headset, watch the future just like you
Ay, we do things that no one ever thought of
Turn up at 5 years old, yell, "Yee!"
And if you ever held a title belt, you know how that go
Right before the bell, after the dance
Would've been cool if Khaled Foley would've gave me the same shit over Shawn Mendes
Yeezy, Yeezy, take it to the floor, replace the blisters
I ain't ever had it, you tried, it stuck, but it's no use
I swear to God that they took the word 'purp'
From the writer vacant for a moment, then give it another try
Cause every time that I vomited, every time I cop it
It's just like the Giuseppe store, get extra fair
She even got a extra pair of Al B, so I can always get my fair share
Poppa, I knew he was really dope, but I just couldn't resist
Tryin' to
